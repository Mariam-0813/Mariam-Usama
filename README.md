    <h4>HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT WHAT PROGRAMMING REALLY IS?</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tells a computer how to perform a task.</li><br>
      <li>Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++.</li><br>
      <li>Programming refers to logical process for telling a computer which tasks to a technolto perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand.</li><br>
    </ol><br>
